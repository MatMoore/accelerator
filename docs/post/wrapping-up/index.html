    <p>Last week was the final week of the project, so this is where I wrap up.</p>

<p>I had intended to blog all the way through the project, but I gave up somewhere in the middle after <a href="https://medium.com/@skyetetra/so-your-data-science-project-isnt-working-7bf57e3f12f1">hitting some
roadblocks and losing motivation</a>. I was quite busy with other things at the time so I wanted to keep more of my evenings and weekends free.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t stop writing things down, but I stuck to notetaking instead of blogging. When I was stuck on something I found it useful to write down my goals at the beginning of the day - what did I want to implement, what questions did I want to answer, and if I get result X what will that tell me and what should I try next. I found this helped keep me on track and feel less bad about not using my limited time well.</p>

<p>In the final week I had to give a presentation on what I&rsquo;d done over the course of the data science accelerator, and I&rsquo;m going to attempt to convert that into a series of blog posts. So in the next couple of posts I&rsquo;ll try and explain what I accomplished through the project, what I learned, and what I didn&rsquo;t finish.</p>
