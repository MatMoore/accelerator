<p>Hi! Over the next 3 months I&rsquo;m going to be spending 1 day a week working on
a project as part of the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-science-accelerator-programme/introduction-to-the-data-science-accelerator">data science accelerator programme</a>. I&rsquo;m encouraged to keep a journal and I thought a blog would be a good way to do it.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I currently work as a software developer on GOV.UK, the website used by
people in the UK to access government services and information online.</p>

<p>There are about 400,000
different pages on the site, and this content is published by many different
departments and agencies.</p>

<p>A lot of the work I&rsquo;ve been involved with has been about how to manage and
structure all this content so users can find stuff.</p>

<p>Part of that work has been on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search?q=yams">search functionality</a>, which is what my project will focus on.</p>

<h2 id="rough-plan">Rough plan</h2>

<p>For this project I want to use historical search logs to understand how to improve the ordering
of search results so that users see more <strong>relevant</strong> pages quicker (i.e. the documents are helpful to the user that entered the query).</p>

<p>These are my initial thoughts on what I want to do at the start of the project (they may change!)</p>

<ol>
<li>Given data about what users clicked on, judge the intrinsic relevance of each link displayed on a result page for a query. Prior art: <a href="https://github.com/gds-attic/search-performance-dashboard/blob/master/dashboard/performance.py">Search performance dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>Build a tool to evaluate how good search result pages are, based on these judgements. This should be something developers can run for an unreleased version of search, with a representative set of queries, so that they can predict performance <em>before</em> deploying the code.</li>
<li>Explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank">Learning to Rank</a> using the relevance judgements as training data.</li>
</ol>

<p>My next post gives some <a href="/post/background-govuk-search">background on how GOV.UK search works now</a>.</p>
