<p>This week was really unproductive. I hit some roadblocks with the data so I didn&rsquo;t accomplish what I set out to do on Thursday. I&rsquo;m finding this really stressful at the moment as I&rsquo;m really worried that I won&rsquo;t be able to get the data I need to actually do the project I proposed. ðŸ˜ž</p>

<h2 id="what-i-planned-to-do-thursday">What I planned to do Thursday</h2>

<p>My aim for this weak was to work out how to use Google BigQuery to fetch the data I need instead of the google Analytics API, because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s really slow to extract data from the API (it took me a couple of hours just to get one day&rsquo;s worth of data)</li>
<li>The data I get from the API summarises what happens in a search session, but doesn&rsquo;t show me the individual click events and what order they happened in</li>
</ol>

<p>The 2nd part is important because the last link clicked within a search session can be seen as an endorsement of the link for that query by the user. If I train a learning to rank model, I want the model to be able to predict what the final click was for a test dataset. If I can confidently predict that a user will choose result #4 over result #1-3 for a given query (while accounting for position bias), then it&rsquo;s reasonable to generate a new ranking with #4 at the top.</p>

<p>Using last click as a measure of satisfaction assumes that users are very persistent and will keep looking for the best result rather than leaving the site straight away if they&rsquo;re not satisfied after clicking a link. This probably isn&rsquo;t super realistic, but it&rsquo;s a starting point and I can weaken this assumption later on if it doesn&rsquo;t work well.</p>

<p>The raw data I want to extract from BigQuery should have these columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>sessionId (fullVisitorId + visitId)</li>
<li>search term</li>
<li>final URL clicked</li>
<li>ranking of final URL clicked</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>When I query BigQuery, I have access to all the fields defined in the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en">BigQuery export schema</a>.</p>

<p>This allows me to query individual sessions, and &ldquo;hits&rdquo;, which are events like individual pageviews.</p>

<p>There are nested fields such as &ldquo;hits.product.productListName&rdquo; which appear to capture the same Ecommerce events I&rsquo;m querying through the API, but whenever I write BigQuery queries that touch these fields, I get no data back - all these fields appear to be null.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try and get help from my coworkers with this, because I can&rsquo;t work out why this doesn&rsquo;t work and even very simple queries don&rsquo;t return what I expect. I&rsquo;m really hoping someone has written a query involving these fields before.</p>

<p>Another problem I ran into is that while I have permissions to run any query I want, I don&rsquo;t think I can actually extract the data. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data#export_limitations">The way I planned on doing this requires creating a table</a>, which I don&rsquo;t have permission to do at the moment. That said, I could also run the query from python, which I haven&rsquo;t tried yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did-instead">What I did instead</h2>

<p>Although I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to get the data I need out of BigQuery, I learned a bit about how to use BigQuery itself.</p>

<p>It turns out there are two SQL dialects you can use with it. I started out using Legacy SQL, which you have to opt-out of, even though all the documentation steers you away from it. I also had
a bunch of example queries written in this dialect.</p>

<p>Legacy SQL is very bespoke to BigQuery, but I&rsquo;ve found it slightly easier to write so far. This is because BigQuery makes heavy use of these &ldquo;nested fields&rdquo;. With legacy SQL, it will normally &ldquo;unnest&rdquo; them for you automagically, so you can treat it as if you&rsquo;ve joined in another table, but you don&rsquo;t actually have to write a join clause for it.</p>

<p>Standard SQL is the newer thing, and you have to explcitly deal with these nested fields. However, it&rsquo;s slightly easier to do certain things because it&rsquo;s SQL 2011 compliant, so
I can use write queries the same way I would with Postgres or any other DBMS.</p>

<p>I ended up writing a <a href="https://github.com/MatMoore/accelerator/blob/master/queries/sequences.sql">huge SQL query</a> that fetches me all hits in a search session. It currently includes all pages the user went to after hitting a search page, but this could easily be refined by using the referer page to filter out anything that was not a direct link from search.</p>

<p>What this doesn&rsquo;t tell you is what position the link was in when the user clicked it. This comes from the Ecommerce data which I can&rsquo;t get to work. I thought it would still be useful to write this as an exercise, so that if I do figure out to query the ecommerce data, I can adapt this to return what I want.</p>

<h2 id="backup-plan-keep-using-the-api">Backup plan - keep using the API</h2>

<p>While I was looking at BigQuery I also extended my code for querying the google analytics API, so that it can fetch data for longer periods of time (in 1 hour chunks).</p>

<p>This sort of gives me the data I need but can&rsquo;t tell me which order things were clicked in. I can&rsquo;t use this to determine the last clicked link, unless I just assume it&rsquo;s always the clicked result with the highest rank.</p>

<p>I think this is an option I could explore if I need to, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be as reliable as using BigQuery and it would take forever to run if I wanted to extract data for several months. So I&rsquo;m not very confident in this approach.</p>
