      <description>I postponed my project day on week 4, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to make up the time next week instead. This week I joined a new team at work, and I also had some data issues to work out, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make better use of my time this way. I can hopefully work on it uninterrupted on Thursday and Friday.
So this week I&amp;rsquo;ve just been working on the project when I&amp;rsquo;ve had free time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve written code to extract the data I need and I&amp;rsquo;ve also loaded it into a postgres database so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for me to query.</description>
