      <description>This is the first in a series of blog posts about what I worked on for my data science accelerator project at GDS.
Recap: why did I propose this project? GOV.UK is all about joining up goverment services and information so users can find stuff and understand goverment. This is hard because the government is not a single entity - it&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of separate departments and agencies with different priorties, responsibilities and ways of working.</description>

      <description>Last week was the final week of the project, so this is where I wrap up.
I had intended to blog all the way through the project, but I gave up somewhere in the middle after hitting some roadblocks and losing motivation. I was quite busy with other things at the time so I wanted to keep more of my evenings and weekends free.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t stop writing things down, but I stuck to notetaking instead of blogging.</description>
