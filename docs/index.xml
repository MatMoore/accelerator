      <description>This week my main goal was to get some data and explore it.
I spent most of it figuring out how the Google Analytics API works. I found this quite daunting at first because the &amp;ldquo;getting started&amp;rdquo; documentation doesn&amp;rsquo;t link to a proper reference, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good understanding of the concepts behind google analytics. But I found a couple of useful resources:
 The dimensions and metrics explorer gave me most of the information I needed to query the API.</description>

      <description>The search functionality on GOV.UK is built using an open source search engine, Elasticsearch.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how GOV.UK search uses elasticsearch to generate search results, and some of the problems with it.
Indexing Whenever a new document is published, it automatically gets added to a search index. When you index a document, elasticsearch analyses the document&amp;rsquo;s text, which involves lowercasing, stripping out diacretics, breaking it into tokens, stemming words, substituting synonyms etc.</description>

      <description>Hi! Over the next 3 months I&amp;rsquo;m going to be spending 1 day a week working on a project as part of the government data science accelerator programme. I&amp;rsquo;m encouraged to keep a journal and I thought a blog would be a good way to do it.
Background I currently work as a software developer on GOV.UK, the website used by people in the UK to access government services and information online.</description>
